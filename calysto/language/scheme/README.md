You can install Calysto Scheme with:

```
pip install calysto-scheme
```

And use it in the console, qtconsole, or notebook with IPython 3:

```
ipython console --kernel calysto_scheme
ipython qtconsole --kernel calysto_scheme
ipython notebook --kernel calysto_scheme
```
To use it with IPython 3, you will need the development version if it hasn't been released yet. See "Installing the development version" at http://ipython.org/ipython-doc/dev/install/install.html.
